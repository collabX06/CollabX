### **What is Firestore?**  
Firestore (also called **Cloud Firestore**) is a **NoSQL cloud database** provided by Google’s Firebase platform. It is used to **store, sync, and manage data** for web and mobile applications **in real-time**.  

#### ✅ **Key Features of Firestore**  
- **NoSQL Database** – Stores data in **documents and collections**, not tables like SQL databases.  
- **Real-Time Updates** – Automatically syncs data across all users (useful for chat apps, collaborative platforms).  
- **Cloud-Based** – No need to manage servers; Google handles everything.  
- **Scalability** – Can handle small to medium applications without performance issues.

### **How Firestore Database Works?**  

Unlike traditional databases (which use **tables and rows** like Excel), Firestore uses a **document-based structure**:  

📂 **Collection (Folder) → Documents (Files) → Fields (Data inside files)**  

For example, if we are storing **research projects**, the structure would look like this:  

```
📂 ResearchProjects (Collection)
   📄 Project1 (Document)
      📌 Title: "AI in Healthcare"
      📌 Author: "John Doe"
      📌 Year: 2024
   📄 Project2 (Document)
      📌 Title: "Blockchain Security"
      📌 Author: "Jane Smith"
      📌 Year: 2025
```

### **Firestore vs. Traditional SQL Databases**  

| Feature | Firestore (NoSQL) | SQL Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Structure** | Documents & Collections | Tables & Rows |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible (dynamic data) | Rigid structure (fixed schema) |
| **Scaling** | Easy to scale | Can be complex at scale |
| **Best For** | Real-time apps, fast development | Complex queries, structured data |

### **What is Firebase Hosting?**  

Firebase Hosting is a **fast and secure way to deploy web applications**. It allows developers to:  
- **Host websites with a single command** (easy to use).  
- **Use a free SSL certificate** for security (HTTPS).  
- **Serve content from Google's CDN** (fast loading speed worldwide).  

---

### **How Firebase Hosting Works?**  

1️⃣ **Upload Website Files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to Firebase.  
2️⃣ Firebase **stores these files** on Google's cloud servers.  
3️⃣ Users can access the website through a **custom URL** (e.g., `yourproject.web.app`).  

✅ **Advantages of Firebase Hosting:**  
- **Super fast** because it uses Google’s Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
- **Secure** with built-in HTTPS and authentication support.  
- **Easy Deployment** using a single command:  
  ```
  firebase deploy
  ```

### **How We Use Firestore & Firebase Hosting in Our Prototype?**  

1. **Firestore stores research projects** (Title, Author, Year, Files).  
2. **Firebase Hosting serves the web app** (HTML + JavaScript UI).  
3. **User authentication (Google Login)** is handled using Firebase Authentication.  

📌 **Final Takeaway:**  
- Firestore is **a cloud database** for storing data.  
- Firebase Hosting **deploys websites** on Google’s servers.  

---What you skip by using Firebox
Backend Setup:

No server-side logic is implemented. This means you cannot:
Process user input dynamically.
Fetch real-time data from APIs or databases.
Handle authentication, authorization, or user roles.
Database Management:

Firebox doesn’t allow integration with real databases like MongoDB or MySQL.
Instead, you’ll use static data or mock APIs for testing.
Complex Features:

Dynamic updates, such as chat systems, notifications, or dashboards, are absent.
No support for real-time data handling using tools like WebSockets.
Security:

Since there's no backend, there's no encryption or protection for sensitive data like passwords.
Hosting for Scale:

Firebox prototypes are hosted for design purposes, not for serving actual user traffic or scaling to production needs.
